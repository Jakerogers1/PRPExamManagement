# PRPExamManagement

This project will provide a secure and user-friendly platform for UNC Computer Science to administer the Graduate PRP exam process. It enables students to register, submit appropriate exam materials, and allow administrators to manage exam processes efficiently.

The Graduate PRP Exam Management System is designed to streamline the process of registering, administering, and managing graduate studentsâ€™ PRP exams. The software will serve graduate students, faculty, and administrators by automating exam-related tasks. Features such as registering for exams, automated email reminders, interview scheduling, and status tracking will improve the overall process efficiency.

The system will create a consolidated environment where key data such as student names, PIDs, exam status, and advisor information is stored and managed with ease. The system will feature a user-friendly interface for easy navigation, with a backend designed to manage application logic and data storage. This setup will streamline administrative tasks and help students manage their exam milestones more efficiently. We aim to create a system that both students and administrators will benefit from.
